This is a repository for scripts that build Ada programming environment
for Slackware.

The build order will be
* gcc
* xmlada
* gtkada
* gprbuild
* gps
* aunit
* gnatcoll
* asis
* florist
* gnatmem

For gcc, you will need the original build data from stock Slackware source.
Recommend to use gcc version >= 4.7.0.  The resulting compiler will replace
the system compiler.

For gnatmem, you also need the binutils source and build the binutils first.

It was tested on Slackware64 13.37 with gcc 4.7.0
