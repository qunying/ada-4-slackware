This is a repository for scripts that build Ada programming environment
for Slackware.

The build order will be
* gcc
* gnat-env
* xmlada
* gprbuild
* gnat_util
* gtkada
* aunit
* gnatcoll
* langkit
* quex
* libadalang
* gps
* florist
* asis
* gnatmem
* adactl

It has been updated for Slackware current, GCC 7.3.0 and gnat GPL 2017

For gnatmem, you also need the binutils source and build the binutils first.

PS. * gtkada's document now depends on gnatdoc in GPS.
