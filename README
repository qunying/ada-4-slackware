This is a repository for scripts that build Ada programming environment
for Slackware.

The build order will be
* gcc
* xmlada
* gtkada
* gprbuild
* gps
* aunit
* gnatcoll
* asis
* florist
* gnatmem

For gcc, you will need the original build data from stock Slackware source.
Recommend to use gcc version >= 4.7.0.  The resulting compiler will replace
the system compiler.

For XmlAda, the version of 4.2w, xmlada-for-gps-5.0.1-gpl-src.tgz is used.

For GtkAda, GPS, the svn code is used instead of the GPL 2011 version.

For gnatmem, you also need the binutils source and build the binutils first.

It was tested on Slackware64 13.37 with gcc 4.7.0
