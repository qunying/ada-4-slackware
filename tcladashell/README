Tcl Ada SHell (Tash) is an Ada binding to Tcl/Tk.

Its purpose is to

 * allow a Tcl program to use Ada in place of C to implement Tcl
   commands where additional execution speed, more complex data
   structures, or better name space management is needed, and

 * support the rapid development of Platform-Independent
   Graphical User Interfaces via Tk.
