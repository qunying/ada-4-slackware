gnat_util - GNAT compiler components

With GNAT GPL 2013, AdaCore have extracted internal compiler
components into a library called gnat_util, which is used by
(at least) ASIS and GNATColl.

gnat_util contains components from the GNAT FSF compiler.

At least for ASIS, the components used to build it must match the
components in the compiler, so if building ASIS for use with
(for example) FSF GCC 5.2.0 a version of GNAT Util is needed which
contains components from FSF GCC 5.2.0.

This project provides such a library.

You need to define GCC_SRC_BASE and GCC_BLD_BASE for the corresponding
GCC source and build tree. Otherwise it won't work.
