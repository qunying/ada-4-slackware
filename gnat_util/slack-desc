# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

gnat_util: gnat_util - GNAT compiler components
gnat_util:
gnat_util: gnat_util contains components from the GNAT FSF compiler.
gnat_util:
gnat_util: At least for ASIS, the components used to build it must match the
gnat_util: components in the compiler, so if building ASIS for use with
gnat_util: (for example) FSF GCC 6.2.0 a version of GNAT Util is needed which
gnat_util: contains components from FSF GCC 6.2.0.
gnat_util:
gnat_util: This project provides such a library.
