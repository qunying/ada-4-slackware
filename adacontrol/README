AdaControl (Ada rules controler)

AdaControl is an Ada rules controller. It is used to control that Ada
software meets the requirements of a number of parameterizable
rules. It is not intended to supplement checks made by the compiler,
but rather to search for particular violations of good-practice rules,
or to check that some rules are obeyed project-wide.
