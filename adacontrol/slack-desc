# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

adactl: AdaControl (Ada rules controler)
adactl:
adactl: AdaControl is an Ada rules controller. It is used to control that Ada
adactl: software meets the requirements of a number of parameterizable
adactl: rules. It is not intended to supplement checks made by the compiler,
adactl: but rather to search for particular violations of good-practice rules,
adactl: or to check that some rules are obeyed project-wide.
